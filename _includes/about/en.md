My name is Xiaozhe Yao. I received my B.Eng at Dept. of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University. My research interests include Machine Vision, Neural Science, and Automated Machine Learning.

I am now serving as technical chair at AICAMP.CO.,LTD, a Hong Kong Cyberport Incubatee Company. It is the umbrella company for our open source softwares.

Prior to joining AICAMP, I was the co-founder of Zhitan Technology in Shenzhen, and lead the backend department. Before that, I joined Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Research, Chinese Academy of Science as a Data Scientist (Intern). At SIAT, I developed a food recognition and recommendation algorithm and devoted it to Zhitan Technology.
